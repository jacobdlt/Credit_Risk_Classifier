# Credit Risk Classification

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to build a supervised machine learning model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Using lending data that included information about borrowers such as loan size, income, number of accounts, interest rate, etc. I predicted whether they fell into a "healthy loan" or "high risk" category.

I first read the lending data into a Pandas dataframe from the .csv file and created features (X) and labels (y) sets from the columns, with the loan_status column being the label and the rest features. 

I then used the .value_counts function to determine the balance of the label variable

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
